# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We generally support the **latest release** of the single-file app (`index-Release-x.y.z-YYYYMMDD.htm`). Please update to the newest release before filing a report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Use **GitHub private reporting**: repo → **Security → Report a vulnerability** (creates a private advisory).
- Include reproduction steps, affected browsers/OS, and the exact app filename tested.

We aim to acknowledge within **3–5 business days** and propose a remediation plan shortly after.

## Scope
Client-side single-file app: browser permissions, microphone handling, local memory/cache.

## Out of Scope
- Third-party browser bugs (report to browser vendors)
- Issues requiring privileged/local system access without user interaction
