# Contributing to X-Frequency

## Ways to contribute
- **Bugs** → use *Bug report* template
- **Features** → use *Feature request*
- **Questions/Ideas** → use *Discussions* (Issues & Ideas category)

## Pull Requests
1. Branch: `feat/...` or `fix/...`
2. Small, focused commits with clear messages
3. Test in at least Chrome + Firefox
4. Open a PR and link related issues

## Coding Guidelines
- Keep patches small; avoid new globals
- No secrets; no unrelated file changes

## Releases
Keep `index-Release-x.y.z-YYYYMMDD.htm` naming. The UI auto-detects the version from the file name.
